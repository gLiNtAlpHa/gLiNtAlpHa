# Hi, I'm Akinlolu Adeboye ✌🏾

Software Engineer based in **UK** 🇬🇧.

I see every day as an opportunity to get better at building **world-class backend systems** 🌍, systems designed to scale under pressure, stay resilient, and earn trust through consistency. 
Here I share thoughts on backend engineering, AI, and system design, plus lessons learned while taking software from  localhost/127.0.0.1 all the way to production and keeping it alive there.

## 🌐 About Me

* 🧠 Backend engineer first, AI engineer when it actually adds value
* ⚙️ I’m intentional about building systems that scale predictably, expose their weaknesses early, and are easy to reason about in production
* 🚀 Have worked on platforms processing **5M+ transactions monthly**
* 🤝 Led teams, reviewed PRs, shipped under pressure, still enjoy the work
* ❤️ Drawn to **fintech, accessibility tech, and education platforms**

I like simple solutions to hard problems.

## 🌍 What I Do

### 🔬 C# / .NET

* Build **scalable backend systems** with ASP.NET Core and .NET
* Design **clean APIs** that frontend and mobile teams don’t complain about
* Think a lot about **data models, transactions, and edge cases**
* Comfortable with **microservices**, but not religious about them
* Prefer boring, well-tested solutions over flashy ones that page you at night

### 🤖 Python 

* FastAPI & Flask for **fast, clean, no-nonsense APIs**
* Integrate machine learning models into production systems with proper versioning, monitoring, and operational ownership
* Hands-on with **RAG systems, vector search, and model lifecycle management**
* Automation, ETL pipelines, background jobs — the stuff that quietly keeps everything alive

## 💡 Highlight Projects

### 🚢 TOS Evolution

A backend-heavy **terminal operating system** built to improve port logistics and operational visibility. This project is all about **scalability, reliability, and clean system boundaries** using **C# and Python**.

### 🧠 AR Emotion Recognition System (Autism Support)

An **AR-powered assistive system** for autistic individuals, focused on **emotion recognition and gaze tracking**. Built with accessibility and real-world usability in mind, one of my most meaningful projects.

### 📊 Student iReport

A modern student reporting platform built with **Expo (React Native)** and **FastAPI**. Designed for real-time reporting, moderation workflows, and analytics — clean APIs, simple UX.

### ✉️ Minimalist Intelligent Email Engine

A deliberately small but powerful email system. No bloat — just **clean abstractions, async processing, and extensibility**. Built to show how far good system design can go without overengineering.

## 🔗 Engineering Philosophy

My engineering hot takes:

* **Boring is good** in production
* **Readable beats clever** every time
* **Scale is a feature**, not an afterthought

I optimise for **systems that last**, teams that can move fast without fear, and software that does its job without drama.

If you’re building something meaningful and need someone who genuinely enjoys backend work, we’ll probably get along 🤝
